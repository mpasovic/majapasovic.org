<span class="versal i9">I</span>t goes without saying that governments and politicians (should) care about the well-being of their people, but also about the sustainable development and progress of their own countries. Oh wait... reality check! That's what you're fooled into believing during the brain-drenching campaign speeches, only to realize that most governments will provide just enough to make you lead your mundane, mortgage-infested lives. Faced with the real threat of destroying the environment as well as eradicating wildlife populations disturbingly faster than anyone could have imagined, governments and their leaders still do not seem to take the issue of environment protection seriously enough. The ever-discussed *carbon emission reduction and sustainable development* continuosly remains an overlooked item on the agenda. Almost every day, we come across the experts' warnings about the dangers of global warming, deforestation, air pollution, rising sea levels, improper waste disposal, and excessive emission of carbon dioxide. At the most recent Paris climate conference, held in December 2015, world leaders and delegates pledged to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial level, as well as to considerably increase the use of renewable energy resources. Moreover, a number of advanced and developing economies presented their programs on carbon emission reduction. For example, "Japan aims to derive 22-24% of its electricity production from renewable sources by 2030 and the European Union plans for them to reach 27% of its final energy consumption, [while] 40% of non-G20 countries which have submitted their contribution have set specific targets in this area, such as Jordan (11% of the energy mix in 2025), Côte d’Ivoire (16% of the energy mix by 2030, 32% with international support) and Algeria (27% of national electricity production by 2030)" [(188 Countries have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions)](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/185-countries-have-committed-to-reducing-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions/). To preserve their forests and nurture biodiversity, many countries have set targets of achieving "0% deforestation by 2030 (such as Mexico), while the Democratic Republic of the Congo plans to plant about 3 million hectares of forest by no later than 2025. China’s reforestation programme, which is already underway, will help to increase the national forest stock by 4.5 billion cubic metres by 2030 compared to 2005, thus doubling the accomplishment of the past ten years" (*188 Countries have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions*). Needless to say that the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015, clearly outlines the 17 goals to be realized over the next 15 years, and seeks to end poverty and hunger worldwide but also to protect the natural resources and take urgent action on climate change.

Sounds ambitious, right? What are the odds that the targets set by certain countries can be realized in due time? Can the preservation of environment and the elimination of poverty and hunger become the things that will actually unify world governments and their leaders? In other words, is the general human population willing to put aside their differences, as well as the possible sources of antagonism, in order to provide a healthy and sustainable environment for posterity? Even though it has been almost a year now since the Paris climate change agreement, many of the world's nations that had pledged to ratify the Agreement and pass it into their laws have not done so yet. So far, it seems that the only nations to actually care about acting promptly on this matter are small island states that have largely been affected by global warming over the last few decades. To lessen the effects of possible climate crisis, and to save the planet by shifting from fossil fuels to green energy by 2100 (which is expected to limit the global warming below 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels), governments ought to incorporate drastic measures into their sustainability programs. Planet Earth has no time left to waste, and our efforts to preserve it are more pertinent than ever.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned about the quick progress of global warming. For example, the last three years have gone down as the three hottest years ever measured: "What we’ve seen for the first six months of 2016 is really quite alarming. We would have thought it would take several years to warm up like this. We don’t have as much time as we thought" [(2016 set to be world's hottest year on record, says UN)](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/21/2016-worlds-hottest-year-on-record-un-wmo). To make the situation even more alarming, the past seven months were hotter than has been recorded so far: "June 2016 was 1.62 degrees F above the 20th century average, breaking last year’s record for the warmest June on record by 0.04 degrees F, according to scientists from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information" (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce).
