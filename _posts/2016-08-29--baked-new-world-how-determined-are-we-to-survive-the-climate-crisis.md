<span class="versal g9">G</span>overnments and politicians (should) care about the well-being of their own people, but also about sustainable development and progress of their countries. Oh wait... reality check! That's what you're fooled into believing during the brain-drenching campaign speeches, only to realize that most governments will provide just enough to make you lead your mundane, loan-infested life. And the ever-discussed *carbon emission reduction and sustainable development* continuosly remains an overlooked item on the agenda. Almost every day, you can come across the experts' warnings about the dangers of global warming, deforestation, air pollution, improper disposal of waste, and excessive emission of carbon dioxide. At the most recent Paris climate conference, held in December 2015, world leaders and delegates pledged to limit the global warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial level, as well as to considerably increase the use of renewable energy resources. Moreover, a number of advanced and developing economies presented their programs on carbon emission reduction. For example, "Japan aims to derive 22-24% of its electricity production from renewable sources by 2030 and the European Union plans for them to reach 27% of its final energy consumption, [while] 40% of non-G20 countries which have submitted their contribution have set specific targets in this area, such as Jordan (11% of the energy mix in 2025), Côte d’Ivoire (16% of the energy mix by 2030, 32% with international support) and Algeria (27% of national electricity production by 2030)" [(188 Countries have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions)](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/185-countries-have-committed-to-reducing-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions/). To preserve their forests and nurture biodiversity, many countries have set targets of achieving 0% deforestation by 2030 (in Mexico), while the Democratic Republic of the Congo plans to plant about 3 million hectares of forest by no later than 2025. China’s reforestation programme, which is already underway, will help to increase the national forest stock by 4.5 billion cubic metres by 2030 compared to 2005, thus doubling the accomplishment of the past ten years" (*188 Countries have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions*). 

Sounds ambitious, right? What are the odds that these targets can be realized in due time? Can the preservation of environment become the one thing that will actually unify world governments? In other words, is the general human population willing to put aside their differences, as well as possible sources of antagonism, in order to provide a healthy and sustainable environment for posterity?       

*To be continued...*
