title: "Women's Quad Rugby Team"
---

<p>
<span class="versal a9">A</span>fter watching <em>Murderball</em>, the documentary about the American male quadriplegic rugby team, I did some research on women&rsquo;s wheelchair rugby teams. Interestingly, it looks like there is no much information about the women involved in this particular sport. Here is the link to an interview with Kerri Morgan, the American woman quad rugby player, who was training to become the first woman on the U.S. Quad Rugby National Team. The <a href="http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/May-2006/Sports-Kerri-Morgan/">interview with Kerri Morgan</a> was conducted in May 2006.
