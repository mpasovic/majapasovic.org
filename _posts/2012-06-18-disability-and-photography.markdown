<span class="versal f9">F</span>or my final research project, I was planning to work on the representations of disability in photography, since photography is my great passion. I am still not sure which disability/disabilities I am going to focus on, and whether I will combine it with race and queer studies, but here are some of the sources that I found useful for my research:

1.  [Disability Horizons](http://disabilityhorizons.com/changing-the-world-one-photograph-at-a-time) is an online magazine featuring articles on arts and culture, sport, travel experiences, relationships, and personal stories all narrated or written by disabled community, or by people who grew up around disability either in their families, social or work environments.
2. [Image of Disability](http://www.imageofdisability.com/homepage.htm) is a website featuring the photographs of disabled people taken by Steven Bloch, who apart from being a professional photographer, works as a journalist and a writer---currently, he is writing a book of fiction on disability. His goal is to raise awareness about disability by presenting it in a more positive light in his photographs.
3. [Article on the possible portrayal of disabled people in photography](http://open.abc.net.au/openregions/vic-central-51bX8hh/posts/photography-and-people-with-disabilities-36gn7bm).
4. Booth, Richard, and Debbie Beckerman. *Power and Movement : Portraits of Britain's Paralympic Athletes*. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley, 2011. Print. This book portrays Paralympic athletes preparing for this year's Olympic games in London.
5. Josh Lehrer is an American photographer whose recent work, [Becoming Visible](http://www.joshlehrer.com/?page_id=265), captures homeless transgendered teenagers on the streets of New York City.

---**Disability and Extreme Sports**---

Another thing that I find particularly interesting in disability studies are extreme wheelchair sports, and I have linked one of the sites which provides an overview of the most famous athletes participating in this sport: [Apparelyzed.com](http://www.apparelyzed.com/support/sport/xtreme_wheelchair_sports.html).

The second website is about [Aaron “Wheelz” Fotheringham](http://www.aaronfotheringham.com/category/news/), a 20 year-old wheelchair moto-cross athlete from Las Vegas, who proves that disability does not have to be a limitation to one's body. He has won a multitude of free style competitions, including the 2005 Vegas AmJam BMX finals.
