  A Lamenting Song for Fireflies: Progressive Destruction of the Environment and
  Its Consequences
---


- We loved with a love that was more than love
- Here come real stars to fill the upper skies, 
- And here on earth come emulating flies,
- That though they never equal stars in size,
- (And they were never really stars at heart)
- Achieve at times a very star-like start.
- Only, of course, they can't sustain the part. â€”Robert Frost, *Fireflies in the Garden*

> Dedicated to *Farasha Euker*

<span class="versal r9">R</span>emember those late summer nights when, even if sitting alone in your garden or courtyard, you weren't really all alone? Instead, you would see a swarm of fireflies trilling around you as scattered lamps. And you have to admit that the sight itself was magical, especially if you were lucky enough to witness such a thing in the countryside or forest. Even if you happened to be caught in complete darkness, being surrounded by dozens, sometimes hundreds of fireflies would give off the comforting feeling of safety and the absence of loneliness. Even more so, your heart and your entire being would be shrouded in an ecstatic feeling of acceptance and belonging. Surely, there is something to be said for nature and its dwellers: even in its crudest and wildest form(s), nature will take you in its embrace, irrespective of your background, skin colour or financial status. Even with its mysterious and diverse dwellers, many of whom science has not fully understood and explained, nature does not impose limitations and certain norms that you have to uphold. The rules are simple: respect your environment and what it offers, and stray away from destroying and eradicating that which is different or unbeknownst to your mind and senses. Perhaps the need to transform and tailor natural habitats and environments to the needs of humans is precisely due to our fear of the unknown, the fear of non-conformity and coexistence with the different species.

As a child, I wondered if fireflies came out at night from a mysterious land/habitat, invisible to humans. A never-ending stream of questions titillated my youthful imagination: "How could I reach their habitat? Even if there was a way to reach it, would I be welcomed into their *community*? Would they be able to pass on their magical skill of lighting up darkness to someone who is *different*? What if they didn't like me enough, and decided to banish me from their luminous swarm?" But little did my foolish mind back then know that these luminous creatures would dwindle in number in the span of a few decades only. Even more so, that things would be completely reversed and that I would never get a chance to be a part of the swarm. This was not due to the decision made by fireflies. There were things more apprehensive and disturbing to think of, inconceivable to a child's mind. As I was growing older I came to learn that the *children of today and tomorrow* will most likely grow up not knowing of the beauty and magic of fireflies. This is mainly due to a morbid need of the *homo sapiens* to take apart, ruin, transform, measure, build, trash and dispose of things, living beings, and natural habitats. And all this for the sake of realizing perishable material gain and exercising supremacy over the world of nature. 

Then, one day--after the childhood age has reached the end--reality hits us with its cruel truth: the summer nights that we used to know have changed substantially, and fireflies have started to gradually abandon the human race. Now, the night sky in the cities is not lit up by these luminous insects; instead, it is strewn with the reflection of colossal glowing glass boards, monstrous skyscrapers, and noisy traffic. Even the garlands of trees and flowers in the countryside and forests have been replaced with concrete, bricks and cement mortar; the waterways are being resized and transformed into areas fit for cargo vessels (as scientists have observed, many species of fireflies like to reside close to water); light pollution is on the rise, due to overpopulated cities and increased traffic; and finally, pesticides have become the staple ingredient of grass, food, and air. All of these factors have largely contributed to a decline in the number of firefly species worldwide. Summer nights have darkened from tufts blue to rust and slategray.

As Ancient Greeks believed, nature is in a constant whirl of creation and self-maintenance. "When the Greek philosopher Pythagoras first called the universe a *kosmos*, he did so because it is a living embodiment of nature's order, beauty, and harmony.[...] When we can view the exquisite grandeur of a forest, mountain range, or the form of a distant galaxy with a clear and untroubled heart, the beauty and harmony of the universe becomes immediately obvious--not through argument, but through direct perception" (Fideler, *Restoring the Soul of the World*, p.34-5). The ability to perceive things directly and through a clear, unbiased method has become almost impervious to the modern mind. We are slowly losing touch with our surroundings, not only with the world of nature, but also with most things playing out around us. We are even losing touch with basic human contact. Some would blame the swift development of technology, but I prefer to believe that our lives have become faster and utterly dreary due to an intense need to accumulate more money. Spending time in nature or with our loved ones is now replaced by an obsessive pursuit of *numbers printed on a piece of paper* that can help us exercise relentless power and arrogance.
