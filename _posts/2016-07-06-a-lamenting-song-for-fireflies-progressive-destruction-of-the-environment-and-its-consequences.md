  A Lamenting Song for Fireflies: Progressive Destruction of the Environment and
  Its Consequences
---


- We loved with a love that was more than love
- Here come real stars to fill the upper skies, 
- And here on earth come emulating flies,
- That though they never equal stars in size,
- (And they were never really stars at heart)
- Achieve at times a very star-like start.
- Only, of course, they can't sustain the part. â€”Robert Frost, *Fireflies in the Garden*

> Dedicated to *Farasha Euker*

<span class="versal r9">R</span>emember those late summer nights when, even if sitting alone in your garden or courtyard, you weren't really all alone? Instead, you would see a swarm of fireflies trilling around you as scattered lamps. And you have to admit that the sight itself was magical, especially if you were lucky enough to witness such a thing in the countryside or forest. Even if you happened to be caught in complete darkness, being surrounded by dozens, sometimes hundreds of fireflies would give off the comforting feeling of safety and the absence of loneliness. Even more so, your heart and your entire being would be shrouded in an ecstatic feeling of acceptance and belonging. Surely, there is something to be said for nature and its dwellers: even in its crudest and wildest form(s), nature will take you in its embrace, irrespective of your background, skin colour or financial situation. Even with its mysterious and diverse dwellers, many of whom science has not fully understood and explained, nature does not impose limitations and certain norms that you have to uphold. The rules are simple: respect your environment and what it offers, and stray away from destroying and eradicating that which is different or unbeknownst to your mind and senses. Perhaps the need to transform and tailor natural habitats and environments to our needs is precisely due to our fear of the unknown, the fear of non-conformity and coexistence with the different species.

As a child, I wondered if fireflies came out at night from a mysterious land/habitat, invisible to humans. "How could I reach their habitat? Even if there was a way to reach it, would I be welcomed into their *community*?" These are just some of the questions that titillated my youthful imagination.
