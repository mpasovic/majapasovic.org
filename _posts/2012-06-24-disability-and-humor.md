title: 'Disability as a Tool for Entertainment: Disability and Stand-Up Comedy'

<span class="versal l9">L</span>aughter and humor are almost never attributed to people with disabilities. The common notion is that people with disabilities are unable/refuse to use humor, because of their condition.  use of humor by disabled stand-up comedians, Maysoon Zayid in
particular, I reflected on the benefits of humor for our bodies and
minds, and the ways disability can be used as a tool for performance.
Through the example of Zayid, an American-Palestinian stand-up comedian,
I analyzed how she depicts and transforms her physical disability
(cerebral palsy), and her ethnic and religious identity into something
that should not necessarily be ridiculed, but looked upon as a means
that creates a sense of community between the viewer and the viewed, for
instead of laughing at her, the audience *laughs with her*. Maysoon
Zayid proves that disability does not have to be *crippling*, as most
members of the able-bodied community would think. On the contrary,
Zayid’s case is a proof that disabled people also have all the silly
requests and big dreams as non-disabled people, and that they also know
how to enjoy life. Stand-up comedy performed by disabled comedians
breaks the stereotypes about disabled people as helpless, frustrated,
depressed and mad-at-the-world individuals. Guess what: Disabled people
know how to laugh, and they are not afraid of humor—they laugh even
about their own disabilities! If you would like to find out more about
Zayid’s life, here is an article about her published in the
[RollingStone](http://www.rollingstoneme.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1146)
magazine. I find it particularly interesting that Maysoon Zayid calls
herself a *disabled chic*, which could work as a supplement to a
*supercrip*. In one of the interviews, Zayid herself elaborated upon her
look as a “disabled chic” stating: “I’m trying not to be the disabled
kid with sweatpants tucked inside her socks!”

Some of the questions I posed during my presentation, on which I am
still trying to find proper answers, are:

1.  As Simi Linton notes in “Reassigning Meaning”: “The question of who
    qualifies as disabled is as answerable or as confounding as
    questions about any identity status. One simple response might be
    that you are disabled if you say you are… The degree and
    significance of an individual’s impairment is often less of an issue
    than the degree to which someone identifies as disabled” (12). This
    is exactly what Maysoon Zayid does! In each of her acts, she
    emphasizes the fact that she is disabled (because of her medical
    condition, and because the doctor who delivered her was supposedly
    drunk), but she also defines her disability through her ethnic and
    religious identity. This makes me wonder *whether disability is
    defined through language, rather than biological or social
    determiners? Does language have enough capacity to assign impairment
    or disability without relying on medical and social norms? Would we
    laugh at these jokes if they were told by an able-bodied person who
    is not a Muslim or Palestinian? What would happen if Zayid didn’t
    tell the audience about her disability?*
2.  *Is it still a disability when we laugh at it? Does Stand-up comedy
    performed by disabled comedians move us closer or farther apart from
    people with disabilities?*
3.  *Why do special education settings lack humor?*

How can we study disability from the perspective of performance?
Stand-up comedy is one type of performance! 1. Stand-up comedy performed
by disabled comedians functions as freak show in a way: the disabled
comedian is on display, all attention is directed towards them, just
like in the theater, but at the same time, the audience is integrated
into overall experience laughing about their own prejudices and
stereotypes with the comedian. In addition, the disabled stand-up
comedian can be viewed as “exotic”, i.e. an unknown or mysterious body,
or *the wonder-crip* who invokes “the extraordinariness of the disabled
body in order to secure the ordinariness of the viewer” (Garland-Thomson
341).

1.  Stand-up comedy engages the audience in a clinical experience (what
    Foucault talks about in *Seeing and Knowing*), by placing them in a
    mutual sensible experience in which the disability or illness of the
    viewed object is reduced or erased. Clinical experience is a moment
    between speech and spectacle.
2.  Stand-up comedy performed by people with disabilities draws a
    distinction between severe and less severe types of disability, and
    the classification of disabilities (which is what Susan Wendell
    speaks of). In one of her performances, Maysoon Zayid recounts her
    experience with a police officer who pulled her over for speeding,
    and she pretended that she has Down’s syndrome to receive more
    empathy and smaller fine, or no fine at all. *How do we distinguish
    between less severe and more severe forms of disability? Do more
    severe forms of disability incite more empathy; do they fall more in
    line with the sentimental and the realistic? How does performance
    distinguish between more severe and less severe types of
    disability?*
3.  Stand-up comedy subverts the eugenic gaze and the issue of
    “feeble-mindedness”, by depicting a comedian as normal-functioning
    and intellectually competent individual who shares similar life
    experiences as the majority of people in a society. The same happens
    in the theater, where a disabled actor functions normally in a
    rearranged setting.
4.  In most, if not all performance including people with disabilities,
    we have the “hegemonic mode of representation, i.e. a combination of
    the exotic and wondrous” (McRuer, *Crip Eye for the Normate Guy*,
    192), or as Garland-Thomson states: “something that satiates the
    humans’ need for ‘extravagant and idisputable otherness of the
    freak’” (Garland-Thomson 65). Just like in the case of Bob Flanagan,
    disabled actors or stand-up comedians may be using their disability
    as a means of surviving by being *sick* and *abnormal*, overcoming
    disability, or simply escaping it.
