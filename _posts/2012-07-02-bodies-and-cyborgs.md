<span class="versal o9">O</span>ne of the defining parameters of
postmodernism is the concept of multiculturalism, and the idea that
gender, race, ethnicity, and diverse religious and sexual identities
should all be placed “under the same tent” (Davis, *Bending Over
Backwards* 13). In the last few decades, disability rights activists
have fought to include disability as a part of multiculturalism; and
they did it rightfully so. Even though it is a fairly new discipline,
which—as Davis indicates, did not come into prominence before the
1980s—disability studies, re-examines and challenges the ways we classify
our identities, and position our bodies in relation to gender, race,
sexual orientation, and physical and social performance. As Davis notes,
“Disability, as the most recent identity group on the block, offers us
the one that is perhaps least resistant to change or changing thoughts
about identity. And most importantly, disability may turn out to be the
identity that links other identities” (Davis 13-14). I find it very
interesting that Davis points to eugenics, and the fact that the actual
scientific study of human beings started around the second half of the
nineteenth century. If we keep in mind that eugenics worked on the
prinicple of getting rid of the “feeble-minded”, people with physical or
cognitive disabilities, homosexuals, people of colour, and the
proletariat—and all of these were looked upon as a type of
disability—then *disability* has been a part of racial, sexual, and
social identities longer than we had thought.

Unfortunately, not much has changed in this respect. To this day, many nations, including some
Western or westernized nations, are ostracizing people of colour and the
LGBT community through passive, but very effective and harmless-looking
means. For example, while in some countries, LGBT people and people of
colour are legally protected from verbal or physical assaults, they are
still denied the right to complete equality and integration. Just take
into account the fact that people of colour still earn less money than
the white people, even in the countries that pride themselves on
freedom, equality and tolerance. Also, what about the fact that most
countries will grant “domestic partnerships” for same-sex couples, but
will not legalize gay marriage? Or what about the fact that in almost every
country women earn less money than men? Davis points to the fact that we
do not live either in modernism or postmodernism, but that we are
trapped in an age he terms as *dismodernism*. We are trapped in the age
where the human need to destroy and suppress any possibility for the
development of a defect is greater than before. What really
stood out to me in this article is Davis’ identification of eugenics
with genetics: “We now openly repudiate eugenics, mainly because of the
Nazis’ use of *negative eugenics*, that is, the direct elimination of
*defectives* from the human race… But organizations in the United States
and England have simply morphed their names into ones that use the term
*genetics*, preserving the Latin linguistic root in both eugenic and
genetic. Now eugenics (or genetics) is carried out through two
avenues—prenatal screening, which works some of the time, and genetic
engineering, which has not worked on humans so far” (Davis 20). Davis
makes a really good point here, because if we think about genetics and
genetic engineering more closely, they are no different than
eugenics—both eugenics and genetics are working towards improving “the
human stock” (20) and removing “genetic defects” (Davis 20). The science
now offers limitless possibilities, such as choosing a sex for a child
before it is even born, choosing a level of intelligence for human
beings while they are still in the womb, developing babies in tubes,
ending a pregnancy if a mother is told that a child will be born with a
certain disability, but the latest accomplishment doctors and scientists are
trying to achieve is the elimination of genes for breast cancer, high
blood pressure, or certain illnesses. Having this in mind completely
changes the way human bodies are created, and the ways we are starting
to distinguish between ability and disability.

*Why do we have a need to recreate bodies and change its original
(natural) functions? What are we afraid of? Can forming a body through a
means of genetic engineering really prevent one from developing an
“impairment” at some point in their life?* Of course not, because in order
to prevent such things, the human race would first need to get rid of
the various modes of transportation, factories and all the technology, which
are the main causes of physical disabilities for the postmodern human. 
Davis also points to the Human Genome Project, which is defective
in itself, primarily because we cannot claim with full certainty that
sexual orientation, intelligence, our physiognomy, or the way we speak
are defined by a single gene. Science now claims that there is such a
thing as a “gay gene”, which determines someone’s sexual identity;
however, in the age of “dissolving boundaries, sexual orientation has
become strangely unhinged, especially with the advent of transgender
politics. When a male-to-female transsexual marries a person who defines
herself as a woman, should that relationship be called lesbian? If an
intersex person chooses a person of either gender, or another
intersexual, how do we define the relationship? In such cases, sexual
orientation becomes the only option that does not define the person in
all ways as fitting into a discrete category” (Davis 17). 

*****
Science has advanced to such an extent that we are unable to tell if someone lives
in a body created in a natural way, or in a body crafted by machines. A
great example of genetic engineering and the ways science can define
one’s sexual identity is the movie *The Skin I Live In*, one of the most
striking movies I have seen in the past few years. Directed by a
well-known Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, the movie shows how bodies
can literally become transformed from one form to another. The movie
depicts a plastic surgeon who kidnaps a twenty-something guy, performs a
sex-change surgery on him, and creates a new skin on the body—softer and
lighter skin— and new bone structure by using the skin and blood of a
pig and other domestic animals. In addition, the doctor even performs a
surgery on the patient's vocal chords, completely changing his masculine
voice into a feminine one. Whether or not we have reached a point where
science can actually do things like this, I am not sure. After watching
the movie, my mind has been filled with the following questions:

1.  Why do we have to fix that which makes us human? Why do we have to
    fix our flaws and the limitations of the body?
2.  How do you perform a gender (since, according to Butler, gender is
    all about performativity) if that gender is forced upon you, as in
    *The Skin I Live In*?
