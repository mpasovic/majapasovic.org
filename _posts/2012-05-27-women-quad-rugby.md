title: "Women’s Quad Rugby Team"
---

<span class="versal a9">A</span>fter watching *Murderball*, the
documentary about the American male quadriplegic rugby team, I did some
research on women’s wheelchair rugby teams. Interestingly, it looks like
there is no much information about the women involved in this particular
sport. Here is the link to an interview with Kerri Morgan, the American
woman quad rugby player, who was training to become the first woman on
the U.S. Quad Rugby National Team. The [interview with Kerri
Morgan](http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/May-2006/Sports-Kerri-Morgan/)
was conducted in May 2006.
