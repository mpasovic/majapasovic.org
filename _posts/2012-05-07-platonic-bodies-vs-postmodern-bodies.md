<span class="versal p9">P</span>lato’s conception of the body, as put
forward in a number of texts, is not only a traditional conception of
the body, but the quintessentially traditional conception that served as
a basis for most later descriptions and analyses until at least the
“Enlightenment”. Despite revisionary works that claim Plato to be the
forerunner of any number of modern ideologies, Plato held essentially
ancient views, which paralleled those of the Orphics, Hermetics, and
Pythagoreans.

There are multiple minor views of what the body is *as such*, but only
very few major views, which could be labeled as the Platonic body,
Cartesian body, and the Foucauldian body, which correspond to the
traditional (pre-modern), modern, and postmodern epochs. The way society
and its individuals view the body impacts all other great questions,
from the existence of God and meaning of life, to the ethics of genetic
engineering. There may be no right answer as to which conception of the
body is most correct, but it can be stated with certainty that the body
is of utmost importance and that Platonic views, long neglected, should
receive the attention they deserve.
