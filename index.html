<span class="versal d9">D</span>ear readers of my online journal: Thank you for entering the realms of a world in which I share my views on different subjects, spanning from nationalism and cultural studies, to disability, gender and film studies. My name is Maja Pašović, and I come from the beautiful Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. This online journalistic project (some still call it blog, ha!) started during my graduate studies at the University of Waterloo, in Canada. It was initially designed for the purposes of the graduate course on Disability Studies and Bodily Rhetorics! Even though I had to make a break in maintaining my journal for a while (for a number of time-management reasons), I decided to assume my writing activities here, and share my thoughts with the interested parties. I would like to share and exchange challenging and highly appealing thoughts on how we experience the world in relation to our bodies, and how individuals, groups, or entire nations construct concepts of normalcy and disabled bodies. Some of the questions I very often think of are: How do we create and perceive a body? Is it through what societies and our own or predominant cultures tell us? Can we define one&rsquo;s values based on our perception of their body, or our understanding of what the <i>normal</i> body is supposed to look like? Does the self-image of our bodies define our interaction with the society?

As you will be able to tell from a number of my posts here, I am a great admirer and follower of the English visionary poet William Blake and his astounding views on the workings of the human mind, body and soul. In his most elaborate works, the &ldquo;Prophetic Books,&rdquo; but also in his paintings, Blake creates creatures, both human and machine-like, which I view as Blake&rsquo;s presentiment of how altered our bodies have/will become. I am an anti-modernist (who is forced to use technology to a certain extent, both for my work and studies), who believes that all of the industrial and technological advances have not made our lives better, but have only stifled our minds and drained our bodies and their capacities. It is very interesting to look at how i-pods, i-pads, i-phones, and i-everything are becoming not objects but embodied subjects defining how we think and position our bodies locally and globally. Does an altered body, primarily a technologically altered body fall into a pattern of disability or normalcy? Are we all disabled bodies if we do not follow the trends of industrial-technological innovations?

The purpose of my writings is not to force views and opinions on the reader&rsquo;s mind. Hopefully, you can contradict some of my expressed views with a critical eye!
