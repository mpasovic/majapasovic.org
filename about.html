<span class="versal i9">I</span>n a world that has come to devalue the benefits of the imagination, as well as the immaterial modes of existence, it has become increasingly difficult to construct a life where the flow of ideas and the desire to create is catered to the individual&rsquo;s need for perfection, rather than a global demand for constant uniformity and dullness. As the executive editor of <em>Luvah</em>, it is my aim to help contribute to the spread of forsaken traditions and traditional approaches to knowledge, which have become almost extinct among the technological jungles we call homes. Perhaps my love of tradition comes from the fact that I was born and raised in the city of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where tradition&#x2014;whether it is in the way one approaches art, music, or literature&#x2014;retains high respect and value. Having grown up in this meeting-place of different traditions, both of Western and Eastern origins, has shown me the significance of cherishing the diversity of linguistic, literary, cultural, and artistic pillars in a society. And irregardless of Bosnia&rsquo;s unpleasant history, life there has taught me that humanity cannot and should not be driven by the sword, but by the simple and unprecedented power of the pen. Unlike the sword, the pen holds an ability to reform human minds, and change the world for the better. And even though many stories throughout history have proven to be misleading, I strive to show that stories&#x2014;when written with the right intention&#x2014;can oftentimes provide consolation and the belonging that we are so desperately in need of.

After experiencing the true power of the pen, I myself started writing stories and poems, even in the days of high school. After receiving my BA degree in English Language and Literature, I decided to take my education further, specializing in Education and Translation Studies, and Literary and Cultural Studies. Prior to my involvement in <em>Luvah</em>, I worked as a translator from English and Spanish to the Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian languages, and as an instructor of English language and writing composition in both Bosnia and Canada. In addition to literature&#x2014;English and German literature, in particular&#x2014;my other interests are creative writing, political theory and international affairs. The latter interest has led me to become involved with several non-governmental organizations that work towards building a sustainable future for the Bosnian-Herzegovinian youth. In my spare time, I write (I also have a blog dedicated primarily to the field of &ldquo;disability studies&rdquo;), explore open spaces and indulge myself in animal and nature photography.
