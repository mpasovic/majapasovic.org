<span class="versal m9">M</span>y name is Maja Pašović, and I come from the beautiful city of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a world that has come to devalue the benefits of the imagination, as well as the immaterial modes of
existence, it has become increasingly difficult to construct a life where the flow of ideas and the desire to create is catered to the individual’s need for perfection, rather than a global demand for constant uniformity and dullness. As the executive editor of *Luvah*, it is my aim to help contribute to the spread of forsaken traditions and traditional approaches to knowledge, which have become almost extinct among the technological jungles we call homes. Perhaps my love of
tradition comes from the fact that I was born and raised in the city of
Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where tradition—whether it is in the way
one approaches art, music, or literature—retains high respect and value.
Having grown up in this meeting-place of different traditions, both of
Western and Eastern origins, has shown me the significance of cherishing
the diversity of linguistic, literary, cultural, and artistic pillars in
a society. And regardless of Bosnia’s unpleasant history, life there
has taught me that humanity cannot and should not be driven by the
sword, but by the simple and unprecedented power of the pen. Unlike the
sword, the pen holds an ability to reform human minds, and change the
world for the better. And even though many stories throughout history
have proven to be misleading, I strive to show that stories—when written
with the right intention—can oftentimes provide consolation and the
belonging that we are so desperately in need of.

After receiving my BA degree in English Language and Literature, I decided to take my
education further, specializing in Education and Translation Studies,
and Literary and Cultural Studies. The latter interest has led me to become involved with several
non-governmental organizations that work towards building a sustainable
future for the Bosnian-Herzegovinian youth. In addition to writing, I also
explore open spaces (mostly on my bike!) and indulge myself in landscape and 
animal photography.
