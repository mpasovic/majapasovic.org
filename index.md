<span class="versal d9">D</span>ear readers and fans of the written word, 
Thank you for entering the realms of a world in which I share my views on different subjects, spanning from nationalism, politics and cultural studies, to disability theory, feminism, gender and LGBTQ studies, as well as critical approaches to film and digital media. This specific project started during my graduate studies at the University of Waterloo, Canada. It was initially created as a part of the graduate course on Disability Studies and Bodily Rhetoric. Over time, this online journal has become a creative refuge for its author; in other words, it represents an amalgam of critical thought and creative approaches to a number of different social, cultural and digital media subjects. 

In particular, this blog challenges how we experience the world in relation to our bodies, and how individuals, groups, or entire nations construct concepts of normalcy and disabled bodies. Some of the questions I address are: How do we create and perceive the body: Is it through what societies and our own or predominant cultures tell us? Can we define one’s values based on our perception of their body, or our understanding of what the *normal* body is supposed to look like? Does the self-image of our bodies define our interaction with the society? I am also largely focused on the ways we perceive the human body with respect to our physical surroundings; the impact of technology on human bodies and the environment, with respect to environmental sustainability, urban spaces and the ways urban spaces can be adapted to people with disabilities.

As you will be able to tell from a number of my posts here, I am a great admirer (and a scholar) of the English visionary poet William Blake and his astounding views on the workings of the human mind, body and soul. In his most elaborate works, the “Prophetic Books,” but also in his paintings, Blake creates creatures, both human and machine-like, which I view as Blake’s premonition of how altered our bodies have/will become. As a sceptical modernist (forced to use technology to a certain extent, both for my work and studies), I believe that all of the industrial and technological advances have not made our lives better, but have only stifled our minds and drained our bodies and their capacities. It is very interesting to analyze how i-pods, i-pads, i-phones, and i-everythings are, instead, becoming embodied subjects defining how we think and position our bodies locally and globally. Does an altered body, primarily a technologically altered body fall within the pattern of disability or normalcy? Are we partially disabled if we refuse to follow the trends of industrial-technological innovations?

Finally, please note that the purpose of these writings is not to force views and opinions on the reader’s mind. Hopefully, you can contradict some of my expressed arguments with a critical eye.
